## Description:

Watch Functionality Video:

Note Taking is an important practice and can serve as a valuable means of documenting crucial details. Writing notes can help anyone by reminding them of ideas, tasks, or assignments, and even new information that could have otherwise been forgotten. Not only does note-taking aid in retention of auditory information, it also facilitates active listening and enhances comprehension by prompting selection of noteworthy points. With a note-taking app, you can capture your ideas wherever you are, ensuring that you never forget them. Digital note-taking also enables you to read and edit your notes on the go, freeing you from the need to stay at your desk or computer all day.

This application brings together multiple different kinds of software to create a note taking application called Coffee Geek. Coffee Geek allows the user to enter a title as well as a note and save them to a list of tasks in a user friendly environment. All the user would have to do is enter our website, press the “Get Started” button and jot down anything they would like into the “Title” and “Text” section. Once they press the save icon at the top of the screen, they will be able to save their note which appears on the left side of their screen in a list.

## Installation:

To install this project, a knowledge of JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js  were required. I had to first install Node.js to my computer and then install the Express and NPM packages. The Express package allowed me to use the express framework in Node.js. It allowed me to create a website which functions as a digital note taker and saves user input as well as deletes it. In order to create this application, HTML, CSS, Client-side JavaScript as well as Server Side JavaScript all needed to be used in order to make the page interactive and give the functionality to save/delete user input values. Methods used ranged from, Template Literals, Arrow Functions, Objects, and Functions, Variables, If/Else Statements, and the server side JavaScript. The web application is intended for the user to be able to visit the deployed URL and have the ability to enter whatever Title and Text they would like. They would also have the ability to save their notes to the left column, where they can read them later, or delete them if they want. The code below makes this happen.
